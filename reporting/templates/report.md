## Methodology

### Data Ingestion (Module 1)
- Parsed XML/JSON vulnerability scan files
- Filtered for High and Critical severity findings only
- Normalized data into unified structure

### Adaptive Risk Scoring (Module 2)
- Applied context-aware modifiers based on:
  - Organization type ({{org_type}})
  - Data criticality
  - Internet exposure
  - Patch delay
- Implemented dampening logic to preserve prioritization
- Assigned priority rankings

### Explainable Trace Matrix (Module 3)
- Built complete reasoning trails for each vulnerability
- Linked evidence to risk assessments
- Documented all modifier applications

### AI Analyst Co-Pilot (Module 4)
- Generated human-readable explanations using local LLM (Ollama)
- Maintained offline operation (no cloud AI)
- Prevented hallucinations through constrained prompting
