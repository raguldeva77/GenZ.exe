## Detailed Findings


### 🔴 Priority 1: Unencrypted Database Connection

- **Vulnerability ID:** VULN-001
- **Affected Asset:** User DB Server
- **Base Score:** 9.8
- **Final Score:** 10.0
- **Risk Level:** Critical

**Context Modifiers Applied:**
```json
{
  "org_type": "+1.0",
  "data_criticality": "+0.8",
  "internet_exposed": "+0.5",
  "patch_delay": "+0.3"
}
```

**Evidence:**  
Port 3306 open without TLS encryption. Database credentials transmitted in plaintext.

**AI Analyst Explanation:**  
This vulnerability is critical for a financial organization because unencrypted database connections expose sensitive customer data to interception. The Priority 1 ranking reflects the combination of a high base severity (9.8) and organizational context factors including financial sector requirements, high data criticality, and internet exposure.

## Methodology

### Data Ingestion (Module 1)
- Parsed XML/JSON vulnerability scan files
- Filtered for High and Critical severity findings only
- Normalized data into unified structure

### Adaptive Risk Scoring (Module 2)
- Applied context-aware modifiers based on:
  - Organization type (Finance)
  - Data criticality
  - Internet exposure
  - Patch delay
- Implemented dampening logic to preserve prioritization
- Assigned priority rankings

### Explainable Trace Matrix (Module 3)
- Built complete reasoning trails for each vulnerability
- Linked evidence to risk assessments
- Documented all modifier applications

### AI Analyst Co-Pilot (Module 4)
- Generated human-readable explanations using local LLM (Ollama)
- Maintained offline operation (no cloud AI)
- Prevented hallucinations through constrained prompting
